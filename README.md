Code samples showing the process described in my AMIA paper on NLP-lite/Rapid Chart Adjudication
by Pradeep Mutalik

This repository provides illustrative code to show the creation of the two key elements described in the paper I will be presenting at the AMIA Annual Symposium 2024 at San Francisco in November 2024: 1) The NLP-lite searches for specific unstructured data of clinical interest in the VA's Clinical Data Warehouse (CDW), written in T-SQL; and 2) The software to support the Rapid Adjudication Display for electronic chart review.

This is not a usual kind of GITHub repository - this is not where the code was developed or is being developed or maintained.  That is all being done in the VA's VINCI platform behind the VA's double firewall, so that it is not visible to non-VA pesonnel or even to the majority of VA-personnel who do not have privileges on VINCI. As such, the original code is not transportable to non-VA systems. Nevertheless, simplified and illustrative code is shown here, which can give those interested a clear-cut idea of the procedures involved, and which should allow replication on other systems and platforms.

This site is currently under construction but should be complete enough within a few weeks. Thanks you for your patience!
